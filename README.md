This is my first complex project of scrimba front end path.
Typing in the search bar the title of the movie you are looking for it is possible to check if it is present in the list , read plot, rating and a few more info about. [OMDb Api](https://www.omdbapi.com/). Then, clicking on + button you can add the movie to your watchlist page. Once you want to delete the movie from the watchlist go to the  page clicking on the top right and press - button of the movie  you want to delete.
